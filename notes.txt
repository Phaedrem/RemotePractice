Tasks:
1. Create a Remote Repository:
• Log in to your GitHub account.
• Create a new repository named RemotePractice. Leave it public and
initialize it with a README file.
2. Clone the Repository:
• Clone the RemotePractice repository to your local machine using git
clone <repository-url>.
• The URL can be found on the repository page on GitHub.
3. Local Changes and Push:
• Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine.
• Create a new file, notes.txt, and add some content to it.
• Stage and commit the changes.
• Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin main.
4. Branching:
• Create a new branch locally named feature-branch.
• Switch to this branch using git checkout -b feature-branch.
• Make some changes in this branch, such as adding a new file or
modifying notes.txt.
• Commit these changes.
5. Push New Branch:
• Push the feature-branch to the remote repository using git push
origin feature-branch.
6. Pull Changes:
• Go back to the master branch using git checkout master.
• Simulate a scenario where someone else has made changes to the
master branch on GitHub. Do this by editing the README file
directly on GitHub.
• Pull these changes to your local master branch using git pull origin
main.
7. Merge Branch:
• Merge the changes from feature-branch into master on your local
repository.
• Use git merge feature-branch.
• Push the updated main branch to the remote repository.
